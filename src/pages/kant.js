   <i>"European politics, philosophy, science and communications were radically reoriented during the course of the ‚Äúlong 18th century‚Äù (1685-1815) as part of a movement referred to by its participants as the Age of Reason, or simply the Enlightenment. Enlightenment thinkers in Britain, in France and throughout Europe questioned traditional authority and embraced the notion that humanity could be improved through rational change. The Enlightenment produced numerous books, essays, inventions, scientific discoveries, laws, wars and revolutions. The American and French Revolutions were directly inspired by Enlightenment ideals and respectively marked the peak of its influence and the beginning of its decline. The Enlightenment ultimately gave way to 19th-century Romanticism." <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/british-history/enlightenment"> (History.com) </a></i>
    <br/> Immanuel Kant was one of the most important figures in the Enlightenment. Below is a famous essay of his that discusses enlightenment.

    One of Kant's major contributions to philosophy was his analysis of the attainment of knowledge. This included exploring the role that perception has in understanding the world around us, and exploring how reasoning can lead to truth. The following is a podcast between philosophers that discusses some of these topics. Start listening at 16:54, and listen for at least 10 minutes.

        explanation="This provides students a good opportunity to learn about Kant in an interesting way and allows them to get a better understanding of why he may have been important and why others may have found him interesting. It helps them with the goal of being able to talk about Kant if he was brought up at a party.

        explanation="This discussion has the sole purpose of helping students discover just how significant Kant's contributions were to modern thinking, and of helping students understand his work in the context of one of the most important historical movements of all time. It gets students thinking about why Kant has the kind of influence he has had on virtually almost every modern intellectual that came after him, and allows them to apply Kant's own ideas to their own lives. I hope the students will take away from this discussion how important reasoning is in our lives, and why we have Kant to partly thank for that."

        explanation="I like this discussion piece because it extends the podcast in a sense that students get to take part in a conversation that they just listened to philosphers having. It gets students to think about whether they agree with Kant's revolutionary thoughts. And whether or not they do, it solidifies his importance in relation to how we navigate our understanding of the world."
